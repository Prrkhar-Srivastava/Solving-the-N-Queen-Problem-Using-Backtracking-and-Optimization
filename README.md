# Solving-the-N-Queen-Problem-Using-Backtracking-and-Optimization
Solution Explanation
Problem Statement: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other (no two queens in the same row, column, or diagonal).
Approach:
Use backtracking to place queens row by row.
Check if a queen placement is valid.
If valid, move to the next row. If not, backtrack and try another position.
